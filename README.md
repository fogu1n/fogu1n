I'm a Brazilian Software Developer living in Vitória, Espírito Santo.</br>
Currently I divide my time in :family: (:sparkling_heart::woman::baby::dog:), work e studies.</br>
With the birth of my daughter, I needed to slow down the pace of my studies, but soon I will be looking to assimilate and learn any good content about programming again :rocket: .</br>
My passion for technology started in 1994 when I had my first contact with a 💻 Personal Computer .</br>
I have been working with development for over 15 years and had the opportunity to work with several programming languages.</br>

Currently I work as a Senior Developer with .NET Core API's, .NET Framework API's, Angular (JS, v9 and v10) and PL/SQL.
